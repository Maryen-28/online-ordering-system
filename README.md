A full-featured **online ordering web application** — a modern platform that allows users to place orders, and manage roles (customers, staff, admin, delivery) for handling those orders.

## 🎯 Project Overview

- Staff/Admin: view and manage orders, update status  
- Delivery Rider: view assigned orders and update delivery status  
- (Optional) Clean UI / UX for storefront or admin dashboard  
- Scalable and extensible — easy to add product listing, payment integration, order history, and more
